      <p>Have you ever wondered about the process behind creating a website? Websites encompass various elements like text, graphics, animations, videos, and client-side computer scripts. Many websites also boast advanced interactive features such as database search functions, online purchasing capabilities, and messaging systems. To be effective, a website must strike a balance between visual appeal and user-friendliness. Given the internet's central role in communication and business operations for organizations and individuals, the creation and upkeep of websites hold significant importance. The job market reflects a strong demand for web developers who possess the right blend of technical and creative skills. For example, web developers are responsible for designing and developing websites, content managers ensure websites are kept up to date, and search engine optimization specialists drive user traffic from search engines to specific websites. In this unit, you'll delve into the features and applications of websites, exploring their integrated components and how they interact with each other.</p>
