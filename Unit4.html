      <p>How are the amazing visual effects in science fiction and fantasy films, and computer games, made? This unit provides you with an introduction to tools/techniques and processes that are used commercially when creating computer animation. Animation is the creation of moving images and has a long history. Today modern animations are usually created using a computer. It is an exciting and fast moving area of creative technology that provides an opportunity to combine creative and technical computing skills, and is one in which the UK excels. The creative industries have grown considerably in recent years and provide increasing employment opportunities. An animator can work in a number of different creative areas: creating effects for live-action films, feature-length animations and computer games. Non-narrative animations feature in online advertising and software interface design.</p>
